This repository contains all of the code and installation files for Moonlight - a piece of software that allows you to stream fully-fledged PC games to a Raspberry Pi using Nvidia's Geforce Experience. To accompany my YouTube channel and tutorial here:

According to Moonlight Embedded's creators "Moonlight is an open source implementation of NVIDIA's GameStream, as used by the NVIDIA Shield, but built for Linux/OSX/Windows.

Moonlight Embedded allows you to stream your full collection of Steam games from your powerful Windows desktop to your embedded system, like Raspberry Pi, CuBox-i and Hummingboard."
